#Pinclone, a Pinterest clone built with Flask

*disclaimer: This project is for purpose of my personal studies.
Feel free to use any of the code, but it is not guaranteed to work correctly and I cannot promise any support.*

##Tutorial
This project builds on the excellent Youtube tutorial "[PyCharm Web Magic: Building a Pinterest Clone](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2geC50roans)" by the JetBrains team. I highly recommend following that, even if you do not use PyCharm. My code will most likely differ significantly from the tutorial, since I tend to explore different alleys while studying. 

##Live example
I plan to host this project for all to see. This readme will be updated with a link to the website.
